# literate-evm-dev

Literate EVM Dev is an effort to create code walkthroughs for the most important projects in the ecosystem to foster better understanding of what's possible with EVM development, encourage better practices, and improve learning experience for newcomers.

If you have a good line-by-line grasp of what makes a particular smart contract system tick _and_ this project or the approaches used are likely to be reused by others, consider contributing to this repo by creating a PR.

- Be specific and precise.
- Don't assume prior knowledge on the reader's part.
- Reference _and credit_ the sources (GH, Etherscan, other authors)
- Self-audit the code to prove/disprove it actually works.
- If available, use original project documentation as the basis for everything.
- If necessary, include code critique and recommend improvements.
